## K9 Classifier

K9 Classifier is a machine learning project that uses ML.NET and C# to identify named dogs in images. The project is designed to allow users to upload an image of a dog, and the system will predict the name of the dog in the image using a pre-trained model.

The training data for the model consists of labeled images of dogs with their respective names. For example, if there are hundreds of labeled images of a particular dog with a specific name, the system will be able to recognize and identify that dog in a new image.

At present, the project is in its early stages of development. In the future, the project will include more features and improved accuracy in identifying named dogs. Stay tuned for updates and further developments.
